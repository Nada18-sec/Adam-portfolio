# Introduction
ELK is a software stack that provides a platform for log management and analysis. It consists of several open-source tools including Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. ELK is widely used for security monitoring and threat detection due to its ability to process and analyze large volumes of data in real-time.

Setting up a Wazuh manager with ELK adds value to the platform by providing additional security features such as intrusion detection and endpoint security monitoring. Wazuh is an open-source security platform that can be integrated with ELK to provide a more comprehensive security solution.

By combining the power of ELK with the security capabilities of Wazuh, organizations can enhance their security posture and better protect their systems and data from threats. In this walkthrough, we will guide you through the process of setting up an ELK/Wazuh manager to help you get started with security monitoring.

# Methodology

# Setting up ELK and Wazuh Manager
1. Install Ubuntu Server on a dedicated machine that will act as the ELK and Wazuh manager.
2. Install Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana by following the instructions provided.
3. Install and configure Wazuh by following the instructions provided by Wazuh.
4. Integrate Wazuh with ELK by installing the Wazuh app for Kibana.

# Installing Wazuh Agents on Endpoints
1. Install the Wazuh agent package on each endpoint that you want to monitor.
2. Configure the Wazuh agent to communicate with the Wazuh manager by providing the IP address of the Wazuh manager during installation.
3. Verify that the Wazuh agent is communicating with the Wazuh manager by checking the Wazuh manager's logs.
4. Configure the Wazuh agent to monitor the desired logs and system events by editing the agent's configuration file.
5. Verify that the Wazuh agent is sending events to the Wazuh manager by checking the Wazuh manager's logs.

By following these steps, you can set up an ELK and Wazuh manager on Ubuntu Server and install Wazuh agents on endpoints for comprehensive security monitoring.

# Prerequisites

1. Download and install Ubuntu Server 22.04.2 from https://ubuntu.com/download/server#downloads (used in this Walkthrough) and allocate a minimum of 4GB RAM, 100 GB storage and 2 CPUs. A detailed step-by-step process has been outlined [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-22-04).

2. Download and install Windows 10 machine to act as the Victim PC as well as the monitoring PC.

# All-in-one Deployment

This outlines installation of the Wazuh server and Elastic Stack components in an all-in-one configuration. For successful deployment, all commands must be run with root user privileges

# Installing and Configuring Elasticsearch
1. `curl -s https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring gnupg-ring:/usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch.gpg --import && chmod 644 /usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch.gpg`
2. `echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list`
3. `apt-get update`
4. `apt-get install elasticsearch=7.17.9`
5. `curl -so /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml https://packages.wazuh.com/4.4/tpl/elastic-basic/elasticsearch_all_in_one.yml`
6. Since Elasticsearch will require certificates and keys to communicate with the Elasticsearch node using SSL, download the config files for the certs and generate the certificates using the commands below:
    1. `curl -so /usr/share/elasticsearch/instances.yml https://packages.wazuh.com/4.4/tpl/elastic-basic/instances_aio.yml`
    2. `/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-certutil cert ca --pem --in instances.yml --keep-ca-key --out ~/certs.zip`
    3. `unzip ~/certs.zip -d ~/certs`
    4. `mkdir /etc/elasticsearch/certs/ca -p`
    
    `cp -R ~/certs/ca/ ~/certs/elasticsearch/* /etc/elasticsearch/certs/`
    
    `chown -R elasticsearch: /etc/elasticsearch/certs`
    
    `chmod -R 500 /etc/elasticsearch/certs`
    
    `chmod 400 /etc/elasticsearch/certs/ca/ca.* /etc/elasticsearch/certs/elasticsearch.*`
    
    `rm -rf ~/certs/ ~/certs.zip`
7. Enable and start the Elasticsearch service:
`systemctl daemon-reload`
`systemctl enable elasticsearch`
`systemctl start elasticsearch`
8. Generate credentials for the Elastic stack pre-built roles and users with the command `/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords auto`and save the passwords on a text file

![Change passwords](/blog/wazuh/pass.jpg)

9. Confirm Elasticsearch status by using the command curl -XGET https://localhost:9200 -u elastic:<elastic_password> -k and using the elastic password generated earlier to get an output as shown below

# Installing Filebeat
1. `apt-get install filebeat=7.17.9`
2. `curl -so /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml https://packages.wazuh.com/4.4/tpl/elastic-basic/filebeat_all_in_one.yml` - this is the pre-configured Filebeat config file used to forward Wazuh alerts to Elasticsearch
3. Download the alert templates for Elasticsearch with  ```curl -so /etc/filebeat/wazuh-template.json h[ttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/wazuh/wazuh/4.4/extensions/elasticsearch/7.x/wazuh-template.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wazuh/wazuh/4.4/extensions/elasticsearch/7.x/wazuh-template.json)
chmod go+r /etc/filebeat/wazuh-template.json`
4. `curl -s https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/filebeat/wazuh-filebeat-0.2.tar.gz | tar -xvz -C /usr/share/filebeat/module` - the Wazuh module for Filebeat
5. Edit the `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml` file and add the elastic password as shown below

![Filebeat output](/blog/wazuh/filebeat.jpg)

6. Use these commands to copy the certificates into `/etc/filebeat/certs/`

`cp -r /etc/elasticsearch/certs/ca/ /etc/filebeat/certs/`

`cp /etc/elasticsearch/certs/elasticsearch.crt /etc/filebeat/certs/filebeat.crt`

`cp /etc/elasticsearch/certs/elasticsearch.key /etc/filebeat/certs/filebeat.key`

7. Enable, start and test Filebeat with these commands which should give an output as shown:

`systemctl daemon-reload`
`systemctl enable filebeat`
`systemctl start filebeat`

`filebeat test output`

# Kibana Installation and configuration

1. `apt-get install kibana=7.17.9`
2. `mkdir /etc/kibana/certs/ca -p`
`cp -R /etc/elasticsearch/certs/ca/ /etc/kibana/certs/`
`cp /etc/elasticsearch/certs/elasticsearch.key /etc/kibana/certs/kibana.key`
`cp /etc/elasticsearch/certs/elasticsearch.crt /etc/kibana/certs/kibana.crt`
`chown -R kibana:kibana /etc/kibana/`
`chmod -R 500 /etc/kibana/certs`
`chmod 440 /etc/kibana/certs/ca/ca.* /etc/kibana/certs/kibana.*`
3. `curl -so /etc/kibana/kibana.yml https://packages.wazuh.com/4.4/tpl/elastic-basic/kibana_all_in_one.yml`
4. Edit the `/etc/kibana/kibana.yml` and add the elastic password

![Kibana output](/blog/wazuh/kibana.jpg)

5. Create a data directory for Kibana in /usr/share/kibana, install the Wazuh Kibana plugin and link Kibanaâ€™s socket to privileged port 443:

`mkdir /usr/share/kibana/data`

`chown -R kibana:kibana /usr/share/kibana`

`cd /usr/share/kibana`

`sudo -u kibana /usr/share/kibana/bin/kibana-plugin install https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/ui/kibana/wazuh_kibana-4.4.5_7.17.9-1.zip`

`setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/share/kibana/node/bin/node`

6. Enable and start the Kibana service:

`systemctl daemon-reload`

`systemctl enable kibana`

`systemctl start kibana`

## Accessing the web interface

Access the web interface using the password generated during the Elasticsearch installation process:

```
URL: https://<wazuh_server_ip>
user: elastic
password: <PASSWORD_elastic>
```

## Installation & Configuration of Sysmon

System Monitor (Sysmon) is a Windows system service that monitors and logs system activities to the Windows event log. It provides detailed information about process creations, network connections, and changes to file creation time. In doing so, it can be incorporated with Wazuh agents to send comprehensive logs which assists an analyst identify malicious or anomalous activity. 

1. Download Sysmon [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)
2. Download the configuration file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular/master/sysmonconfig.xml) and save it as config.xml
3. Save the config file in the extracted folder containing sysmon executable files
4. Run the command `sysmon64.exe -accepteula -i config.xml`
